# Version 2 (Paused)

## Use cases (over v1)
- College
  - Senior : Junior Interaction
  Why would a senior want to interact with a junior?
  We will have to store a lot of information ([Designation, Organization])
- Office
  - Distant colleague interaction
  Why not just use email or approach directly?
- Pub/Cafe
- Shopping Areas
- Tourist Places
- Fitness centres

Maybe just additional filter:
- What do you want? -> Date | Network
